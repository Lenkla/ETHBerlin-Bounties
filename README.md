## How to win prizes for dummies

### 1) Make sure you're eligible to participate!

While participating at ETHBerlin is essentially as easy as contributing to an open source project, you have to be physically present and register at Factory Görlitzer Park to participate in ETHBerlin. If you have not received a message confirming that your application at ethberlin.com was accepted please reach out to joinus@ethberlin.com.


### 2) Before the hackathon

#### 2.1) Form your team

If you don't already have a team, you are welcome to create an issue in the [teambuilding repository](https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Teambuilding). 

You can use this issue as a way to get other participants excited about your project or to brainstorm if you haven't yet defined an exact scope.

#### 2.2) Keep calm, and don't start coding yet!

Hacking starts during the event. Teams can form and ideas can evolve before the hackathon. However, the code base, hacks, and prototypes that you create for any apps competing for prizes or bounties need to evolve only during the hackathon. Apps, hacks, and projects that were built before the event do not qualify and will be excluded from judging and any prizes.

And please don't forget to sync your Ethereum nodes ahead of the event :)

#### 2.3) Check out the prizes available
As the hackathon draws closer we will start to announce additional prizes in this repository.

### 3) At the hackathon

#### 3.1) Register yourself

The hackathon registration is at 13:30 of the 7th. at Factory Görlitzer Park. Hackers registered for the Mitte conference can sign up later at 21:30.

#### 3.2) Start work on the associated Gitcoin bounty

Each prize is set up as a cooperative bounty on Gitcoin, meaning that any number of people can `start work`. 

After you’ve started work, all of your interaction with the prize team can take place on GitHub and in the associated community channel for longer conversations requiring more specific context about your project.

#### 3.3) Buidl

Work on your project as you like. How you work is up to you; We recommend creating a new GitHub repo for your team. However, remember to only begin working on your project after the hackathon begins!

### 4) Submit your project

#### 4.1) What to include

What your submission should have: 

- A link to the [**open-source**](https://opensource.org/licenses) code must be provided. Please keep it accessible to everyone after the submission deadline.
- A short **presentation** file must describe your project. It has to be accessible without special tools. Ideally a PDF, Google slides, or even a hosted recording if you like. The judges need to all be able to access those presentations.
- The **contract address(es)** of your deployed demo must be provided, either on a testnet of your choice (Kovan, Rinkeby or Ropsten) or on Ethereum mainnet; instructions on how to interact with the contract(s) are appreciated.
- A URL to any publicly accessible web-interfaces and demo credentials if applicable.

#### 4.2) How to submit

- **Open track bounties** Your project needs to be submitted to **Devpost** and you should create a pull request on the issue the Gitcoin bounty is associated with. , before Sunday at 12pm, and you can submit your project by creating a pull request on the [Open Track Bounty](https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Bounties/issues/2) issue.
- **Sponsered bounties** If you want your project considered for particular bounties (eg. Aragon, Status, The Graph, etc), you can submit your project by creating a pull request on the issue the Gitcoin bounty is associated with.
- **Community Improvement Prizes** You know the drill, again through the bounty issue ;)
- **People’s Choice Award** Nothing required, just buidl.

You can apply to multiple prizes simultaneously, if you think your project conforms to eachone's judgding criteria.

You can open a PR before the submission deadline and continue to work, but all materials must be finalized *before* the end of the hackathon. Any commits to your project submission after the deadline will not be considered.

### 5) After the hackathon

#### 5.1) Congratulate everyone on a job well-done

Whether or not you get a prize, you deserve to be proud of your work. Thanks for participating in the hackathon!

#### 5.2) Party!

We have in true Berlin spirits parties planned for us all to blow off some steam!
